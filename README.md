# CrisTreeCapitator

Minecraft plugin for the craftbukkit 1.13+ version of the game, which allows players to take down trees faster.

##This repository is not up to date due to changes to the authentification process on github. I'll fix it as soon as I can.
Thank you a lot for your patience. If you really require an updated version of the code (maybe you want to create your own version or something) please do not doubt in asking for it (preferably sending an email to cristichi@hotmail.es, writing a comment in the bukkit/curse page of the plugin https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/cristichis-tree-capitator or sending me a Direct Message on the bukkit/curse web https://dev.bukkit.org/private-messages/send?recipient=cristichi).
